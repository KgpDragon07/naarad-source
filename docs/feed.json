Fondly remembered by many students and admirers. <br>  <br> Amherst - Madhukar Anant Rege passed away at age 92, on September 20th, 2016, after a long illness and a long, full life on three continents. <br>  <br> Born in Ratnagiri on the Konkan Coast of India, he had a happy, active childhood. From an early age he loved drawing and painting and eventually earned a Diploma in Architecture at the J.J. School of Art in Bombay, after apprenticing for a year with the master watercolorist Sawlaram Haldankar. In 1949, at age 25, he set sail for England with the help of his eldest brother Vinayak, where he successfully sat the R.I.B.A. (Royal Institute of British Architects) examination and then completed a post-graduate Diploma in Town Planning. <br>  <br> It was in England that he met and married Gladys Sharp on July 4th, 1953, and, after the birth of their first daughter in 1954, returned to India, where he took up a lectureship in Architecture at the newly formed Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, West Bengal. He was to stay at I.I.T. for 14 years, aside from a year's leave in London and a three-year period in Athens, Greece where he worked with the pioneering Doxiadis Associates, after which he returned to Kharagpur as Professor and Head of the Department of Architecture and City Planning. <br>  <br> In 1969 he migrated to the United States, first as a SPURS (Special Program for Urban and Regional Studies) Fellow at M.I.T. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, then as a city planner for the City of Newton and eventually as a planner for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Communities and Development, where he worked in the Main Street Program on downtown revitalization of Mass. cities and towns. He also lectured at the Boston Architectural Center. When his wife and daughters joined him in 1970, he moved first to Brookline, then to Newton, and, upon retirement in 1993, settled with Gladys in Amherst. After retirement he returned to his first passion, painting, which he had kept up throughout his life, filling his home with beauty. <br>  <br> He was a true Renaissance man: a lifelong reader, always with his head in a book, but also an avid gardener. For many years he practiced yoga regularly. He made toys for his children and most of the furniture for his family, taught himself leatherwork, loved philosophical and political discussions, music, swimming, tennis, and cooking, and was a staunch Democrat, making sure to vote, by absentee ballot, even during his last illness. <br>  <br> He leaves behind Gladys, his loving wife of 63 years; daughters Josna Rege, in Amherst and Sally Rege Carroll, in North Reading, Massachusetts; grandsons Nikhil, in New York City, and Tyler, also from North Reading, currently studying at UMass Amherst; sisters Kumud Rege and Sunita Kulkarni, and brothers Prabhakar and Sadanand Rege, all in Mumbai, India; sons-in-law Andrew and Kevin, many loving nieces and nephews, brothers- and sisters-in law, and fast friends in India, England, and the United States.

The proposed ideas, once implemented, will hopefully push us to the top among the more technologically advanced,efficient and passenger-friendly railway networks.  <br>  <br> 12 Research projects have been awarded to IIT KGP with synergies between the metallurgical, civil, mechanical, chemical, electrical, and electronics and electrical communications departments being the focal point of the plan. The unique Rubber Technology Centre also has a crucial part to play in this project (for those you know who don't know, yes this is a legitimate place in our campus which does legitimate work).A lot of these research projects are in the final stages of testing.  <br>  <br> Let's hope to see our institute shoulder the responsibility of tackling many other pressing issues and live up to our motto. <br>  <br> For further details, please follow the link below: <br>  <a href='http://indianexpress.com/article/education/iit-kharagpur-works-on-projects-to-strengthen-rail-safety-3051841/' target='_blank'> http://indianexpress.com/... </a> ", "created_time": "2016-09-27T16:15:40+0000", "link": "http://indianexpress.com/article/education/iit-kharagpur-works-on-projects-to-strengthen-rail-safety-3051841/", "short_message": "Good Evening! <br>  <br> The efforts to renovate the standards of the Indian Railways, one of the world's largest rail networks, have been set into motion", "real_time": "09:45PM", "id": "156819310131_10154443783670132", "flag": 1, "source": "The Scholar\"s Avenue", "pic": null}, {"real_date": "27-09-2016", "read_more": 1, "message": "Rupak Thakur  and Arkadeb Sengupta, two freshers from IIT Kharagpur  have been awarded the prestigious Aditya Birla Scholarship 2016.This year 15 first year students of the premier engineering institutes have been selected from among the 33 shortlisted candidates through an interview held at Hotel ITC Grand Central  in Mumbai on 24th September.  <br>  <br> Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates them on their achievement!", "created_time": "2016-09-27T14:32:01+0000", "link": null, "short_message": "Rupak Thakur  and Arkadeb Sengupta, two freshers from IIT Kharagpur  have been awarded the prestigious Aditya Birla Scholarship 2016.This year 15 first", "real_time": "08:02PM", "id": "146188872068143_1225200990833587", "flag": 1, "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "pic": null}, {"real_date": "27-09-2016", "read_more": 1, "message": "Rupak Thakur  and Arkadeb Sengupta, two freshers from IIT Kharagpur  have been awarded the prestigious Aditya Birla Scholarship 2016.This year 15 first year students of the premier engineering institutes have been selected from among the 33 shortlisted candidates through an interview held at Hotel ITC Grand Central  in Mumbai on 24th September.  <br>  <br> Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates them on their achievement.", "created_time": "2016-09-27T14:32:01+0000", "link": null, "short_message": "Rupak Thakur  and Arkadeb Sengupta, two freshers from IIT Kharagpur  have been awarded the prestigious Aditya Birla Scholarship 2016.This year 15 first", "real_time": "08:02PM", "id": "146188872068143_1225200990833587", "flag": 1, "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "pic": null}, {"real_date": "27-09-2016", "read_more": 1, "message": "Open IIT || Debate 16-17 <br> Gold : Mithilesh Pinjarkar <br> Silver : Kaustav Brahma <br> Bronze : Abhinav Sharma and Vibhu Narayan Deo <br>  <br> Team ScholsAve congratulates all the winners and participants for putting up an exciting performance.", "created_time": "2016-09-27T12:31:41+0000", "link": null, "short_message": "Open IIT || Debate 16-17 <br> Gold : Mithilesh Pinjarkar <br> Silver : Kaustav Brahma <br> Bronze : Abhinav Sharma and Vibhu Narayan Deo <br>  <br> Team", "real_time": "06:01PM", "id": "156819310131_10154443323545132", "flag": 1, "source": "The Scholar\"s Avenue", "pic": null}, {"real_date": "27-09-2016", "read_more": 1, "message": "Open IIT 2016-17 || Debate Results <br> 1) Mithilesh Pinjarkar <br> 2) Kaustav Brahma <br> 3) Vibhu Narayan Deo and Abhinav Sharma (Shared) <br> Although Rohit Roy got same marks as Mithilesh, yet he could not win because he crossed the time limit and his marks were reduced. <br>  <br> Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates the winners.", "created_time": "2016-09-27T12:01:27+0000", "link": null, "short_message": "Open IIT 2016-17 || Debate Results <br> 1) Mithilesh Pinjarkar <br> 2) Kaustav Brahma <br> 3) Vibhu Narayan Deo and Abhinav Sharma (Shared) <br> Although", "real_time": "05:31PM", "id": "146188872068143_1225187317501621", "flag": 1, "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "pic": null}, {"real_date": "27-09-2016", "read_more": 1, "message": "Technology Transfer Group with Sponsored Research and Industrial Consultancy, IIT Kharagpur in association with Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law is organizing the Launch Event of Institute\u2019s official Intellectual Property Portal and Geographical Indication Portal . <br>  <br> Date -

Despite the introduction of several savings and alternative measures like replacement of traditional halogen street lamps with LED, sensor operated lights and installation of solar panels, this sharp upswing whereas can be attributed to an increase in research facilities and functioning of four new halls viz. RLB, LBS, BRH & NVH; it cannot be ruled out completely that the misuse and wastage do not have a colossal rise. The hall and department wise data obtained from the Electric Office unveils that the consumption has increased drastically in almost every hall and department. <br> Many a times we are seen to leave the lights and fans running while we go to the class; not because of our unwillingness but because of our carelessness. We should always remember that there are still 19,706 villages in our India (Data as of 2015, Census Board, Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India) which remain un-electrified even after 69 years of our independence.
